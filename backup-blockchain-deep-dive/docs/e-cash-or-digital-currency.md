# E-Cash | Digital Currency

## History

1980s: e-cash protocols based on a model proposed by David Chaum



## E-cash System



### Fundamental Requirements

2 fundamental requirements are needed to create an effective e-cash system.

1.  **`Accountability`**: required to ensure that&#x20;

    1. cash is spendable only once (addressing the **double-spending** problem) and &#x20;
       * occurs when digital money is copied and spent multiple times, as it is quite easy to make copies of digital data
    2. it can only be spent by its **rightful owner**.


2.  **`Anonymity`**:   required to **protect usersâ€™ privacy**.

    * Physical cash offers privacy to those who wish to hide their identity, by making it almost impossible to trace spending back to the individual.
      * Digital payments like credit cards lack the privacy of physical cash due to their inherent personalisation,  tracking and logging mechanisms.
      * While tracking in digital payments is necessary for security, it also compromises user privacy and often seen as a `breach of privacy`.
        * End users often have little control over how their data is shared in digital systems, even without their explicit consent.
    * **Cryptography** is used to address these issues.&#x20;



{% hint style="success" %}
David Chaum **solved both problems** during his work in the 1980s by using two cryptographic operations.

1. **Blind Signatures**:  allow the signing of a document without actually seeing it
2. **Secret Sharing**: enables the detection of double-spending
