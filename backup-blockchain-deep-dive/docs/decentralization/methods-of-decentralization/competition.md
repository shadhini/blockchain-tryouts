# Competition

## Contest-driven Decentralization&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
When using a competitive approach,&#x20;

different service providers **compete to be selected** for the system's provision of services.
{% endhint %}

This paradigm&#x20;

* does **not achieve complete decentralization**
* But, it ensures that an intermediary/ service provider is not monopolizing the service to a certain degree



‚ùóBlockchain technology fosters a competitive environment among service providers, with each striving to become the preferred choice.

* smart contracts can select external data providers based on reputation, previous scores, reviews, and service quality
* Although this method doesn't result in full decentralization, it allows smart contracts to make a free choice based on various criteria.&#x20;
