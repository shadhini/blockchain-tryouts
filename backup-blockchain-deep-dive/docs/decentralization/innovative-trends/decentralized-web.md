# Decentralized Web

## Decentralized Web&#x20;

> A vision of the web where **no single authority or group of authorities holds control**.



#### ðŸ“Œ Internet was originally designed to be decentralized

*   The **Internet** was **originally designed to be decentralized,** with open protocols like&#x20;

    * HTTP,&#x20;
    * SMTP, and&#x20;
    * DNS&#x20;

    allowing anyone to freely participate.&#x20;
* This remains **true at the protocol level.**

#### ðŸ“Œ Internet's shift towards centralization

* The emergence of the `Web layer` introduced a **service-oriented infrastructure**.&#x20;
  * This shift enabled large profit-driven companies like `Facebook`, `Google`, `Twitter`, and `Amazon` to dominate, offering excellent services.
  * these business models thrive due to their **high** **standardization** and **service quality**
  * but they **undermine** the original vision of a **decentralized and open Internet**
  * created a **more centralized, controlled, and closed system**

#### ðŸ“Œ Concerns raised by the centralization of Internet&#x20;

* &#x20;pose a threat to **privacy, data protection and decentralization**
  * since a few powerful entities exert substantial influence over the Internet

#### ðŸ“Œ Blockchain as a Solution

Blockchain technology offers a solution by enabling the development of a **decentralized Internet**&#x20;

â€” commonly referred to as **`Web 3`**&#x20;

â€” aligning with the Internet's original intent of **openness and decentralization**.
