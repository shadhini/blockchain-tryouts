# Full-ecosystem Decentralization

Blockchain - a distributed ledger that runs on top of conventional systems&#x20;

* includes following elements&#x20;
  1. Storage
  2. Communication
  3. Computation
* and other factors such as
  1. Identity
  2. Wealth



## 1. Storage

{% content-ref url="storage.md" %}
[storage.md](storage.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 2. Communication

{% content-ref url="communication.md" %}
[communication.md](communication.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 3. Computation

{% content-ref url="computation-computing-power.md" %}
[computation-computing-power.md](computation-computing-power.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The **blockchain** has the potential to address various decentralization-related issues.
{% endhint %}

* Zooko's triangle concept related to identity requires a naming systems in network protocols that is secure, decentralized and capable of providing human-meaningful and memorable names to the users.&#x20;
  * Although there was an opinion that a system can have only two of these properties simultaneously, `Namecoin` addresses this issue.
  * However, challenges like user-stored private keys raise questions about the suitability of decentralization for specific problems.



{% hint style="danger" %}
Decentralization may not be suitable for every situation, as centralized systems with established reputations often perform better in many cases.
{% endhint %}

* Email platforms from reputable companies, offer better service than private internet hosting.



{% hint style="info" %}
Blockchain technology enables the creation of Decentralized Organizations (DOs) as software versions of traditional physical organizations.
