# Evaluating Requirements for Decentralization

## Applicable deciding factors when evaluating blockchain platforms for a use case

Nakamoto coefficient: depending on the use case&#x20;

* It is best to be as decentralized as possible, however, depending on the use case, decentralization can be given up to a certain degree.

{% hint style="success" %}
The **selection of** a **blockchain** platform is **determined by** the specific **use case** and **user** **requirements**.
{% endhint %}



## 4 Question Framework to Evaluate the Decentralization Requirement

Work on \[6] proposes a framework with 4 questions to evaluate the decentralization requirements in the context of blockchain technology.&#x20;

### 1. What is being decentralized?

— The system

e.g:&#x20;

* identity system, trading system



### 2. What level of decentralization is required?

— `full disintermediation` | `partial disintermediation`



### 3. What blockchain is used?

e.g:

* Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum blockchain etc.



### 4. What security mechanism is used?

e.g: security mechanism

* atomicity-based;  here, either the transaction executes in full or transaction does not execute at all
  * a deterministic approach that ensures the integrity of the system
* mechanisms based on reputation
  * allows for varying degrees of trust in the system&#x20;



## Example Evaluation: Money Transfer System

<table><thead><tr><th width="270" align="center">Question</th><th>Answer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">What is being decentralized?</td><td>a money transfer system</td></tr><tr><td align="center">What level of decentralization is required?</td><td>Disintermediation</td></tr><tr><td align="center">What blockchain is used?</td><td>Bitcoin; the longest-established blockchain</td></tr><tr><td align="center">What security mechanism is used?</td><td>Atomicity</td></tr></tbody></table>

The proposed money transfer system&#x20;

* can be decentralized by removing the intermediary,&#x20;
* implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain, and that&#x20;
* a security guarantee can be provided via atomicity.
