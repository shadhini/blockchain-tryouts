# Decentralization in Practice

## Smart Contracts&#x20;

[Smart Contracts](../../blockchain/blockchain-architecture/generic-elements-of-the-blockchain.md#smart-contracts)



## AA: Autonomous Agents&#x20;

> **AA: Autonomous Agents**
>
> a software entity that acts on behalf of its owner to achieve desired goals without requiring any intervention from its owner
>
> ‚Äî artificially intelligent or traditionally programmed software



## DOs: Decentralized Organizations&#x20;

> **DOs: Decentralized Organizations**
>
> software programs run on blockchain that mimic real-life organizations with people and protocols
>
> * rely on human input to execute business logic

* DO is added as a smart contract or set of smart contracts on the blockchain
* Once added to the blockchain, the DO becomes decentralized and allows network parties to interact based on DO software code



## DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

> **DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations**
>
> software programs run on blockchain with embedded governance and business logic rules
>
> * **fully automated** &#x20;
> * contain artificially intelligent logic
> * **The code is** considered **the governing entity**&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**The code** serves as **the governing entity**  rather than people or paper contracts.

* This code is maintained by a **human curator** who also acts as a **proposal evaluator** for the community.
* If sufficient input form participants (token holders) is received, then DAOs can hire external contractors.
{% endhint %}

### DAOs vs DOs

* fundamentally same
* main difference: **DAOs** are **autonomous** while DOs aren't
  * **DAOs are autonomous:** fully automated  and contain artificially intelligent logic
  * DOs rely on human input to execute business logic



### Example DAO projects

* introduction of DAOs -> with `Ethereum`
* most famous DAO project ->  `The DAO`&#x20;
  * raised $168 million in its crowdfunding phase ‚Äî a venture capital fund&#x20;
  * was hacked due to a code bug
    * Millions of dollars worth of ETH (ether currency) were siphoned from the project and subsequently transferred to a child DAO created by hackers
    * To reverse the hack's impact and recover funds, a hard fork (major network change) on Ethereum blockchain was needed.
    * ‚áí The incident sparked debates on security, quality, and need for thorough code testing in smart contracts.

{% hint style="info" %}
**A venture capital (VC) fund** is a type of investment fund that provides financial support to early-stage companies with high growth potential. These companies are often startups or small businesses that have not yet achieved significant revenue or profitability.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Smart contract code** should be **thoroughly tested**.
{% endhint %}



### Current Status of DAOs

* currently lack legal status&#x20;
  * has intelligent code and potential to enforce specific protocols and conditions
  * but has no value in real-world legal system at present
* In the future, if a law enforcement agency or regulator commissions an AA (a code that runs without human intervention) containing rules and regulations that can be embedded in a DAO, it will ensure its legal and compliance integrity.

{% hint style="warning" %}
DAOs' decentralized nature allows them to **operate in any jurisdiction**,&#x20;

raising questions about&#x20;

how the current **legal system** can be **applied to diverse jurisdictions and geographies**.
{% endhint %}



## DAC: Decentralized Autonomous Corporations&#x20;

> **DAC: Decentralized Autonomous Corporation**
>
> like a DAO in concept
>
> considered as subset of DAOs
>
> * can **earn** **profits** through shares and dividends
> * operate automatically without human intervention, based on programmed logic.

#### DAC vs DAO

* main difference:&#x20;
  * **DAOs** are typically **nonprofit**&#x20;
  * **DACs** can **earn** **profits** through shares and dividends



## DAS: Decentralized Autonomous Societies&#x20;

> **DAS: Decentralized Autonomous Societies**
>
> a society that can function on a blockchain using combination of multiple, complex smart contracts, DAOs and autonomous decentralized applications (DApps)

* not a free-for-all approach
* not based on an entirely liberation idoelogy
* **can be used** to **deliver various government services**
  * identity cards, passports, records of deeds, marriages, births



{% hint style="info" %}
**Blockchain offers a potential solution for corrupt governments**.

In case, central systems fail to provide the necessary levels of trust for a society,

Then that society can establish virtual trust systems on blockchain, driven by decentralized consensus and transparency
{% endhint %}



### Algocracy

{% hint style="info" %}
**Algocracy:** government by algorithm

a management model that uses algorithms to automate or semi-automate tasks and aspects of everyday life

‚Äî computer algorithms manage and automate public services like law, regulation, economics, policies, and decision-making.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Blockchain and DApps** are **ideal for enabling algocracy** when **combined with AI**, offering a more elegant approach to algorithmic governance.
{% endhint %}



#### Threats associated with Algocracy

‚ùóTraditional algocracy without blockchain

* Increasing reliance on governance by algorithms&#x20;
* ‚ï∞**---**‚û§ Threat to active human participation and real-life decision-making

üëâ However, when combined with blockchain, the situation improves.

* Blockchain's decentralized, community-driven model enables the collective approval and scrutiny of governance algorithms by the community or society operating within the blockchain network.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Blockcracy**_: **government by blockchain**

vision of a blockchain powered by artificially intelligent smart contracts (algorithms) that take responsibility for governance
