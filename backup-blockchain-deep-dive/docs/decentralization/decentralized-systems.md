# Decentralized Systems

### Systems pre-date blockchain and Bitcoin that are decentralized to a certain degree

* BitTorrent&#x20;
* Gnutella file-sharing system

{% hint style="info" %}
The community's participation in these projects decreased gradually due to the absence of any incentivization mechanism.
{% endhint %}



### Systems following Bitcoin&#x20;

* **Bitcoin** blockchain - popular choice due to its proven resilience and security
  * has the highest Nakamoto coefficient&#x20;
* **Ethereum** - more prominent choice due to its flexibility; ability to program business logic into the blockchain through smart contracts
* **Polkadot**, **Solana**, **Cardano** - newer platforms for decentralization
