# Decentralization

> **Decentralization**:
>
> Basic idea: to distribute control and authority to the peripheries of an organization instead of it being concentrated in one central body
>
> * gives full control to users
> * no single point of failure&#x20;
> * no single trusted authority



## Blockchain Decentralization Model

`Blockchain` -> provides a platform that does not need any intermediaries and that can function with **leaders chosen over time via consensus** mechanisms

* This model allows **anyone** to compete to **become** the **decision-making authority**.&#x20;
* This **competition** is **governed** **by** a **consensus** mechanism; Consensus Algorithms.&#x20;



{% hint style="info" %}
Blockchain allow **anyone to start a decentralized system** and operate it with no single point of failure or single trusted authority.

*   It can either&#x20;

    * be run autonomously or&#x20;
    * by requiring some human intervention,&#x20;

    depending on the type and model of governance used in the decentralized application running on the blockchain.
