# Centralized Vs Distributed Vs Decentralized Networks

## Centralized Systems  &#x20;

> **Centralized System**:
>
> Conventional (client-server) IT systems&#x20;
>
> * a single authority controls and is solely in charge of all operations on the system
> * all users are dependent on a single source of service
> * database or application servers are under the control of a central authority, such as a system administrator



E.g: online service providers using centralized model to deliver services

* Google
* Amazon
* eBay
* Yahoo!&#x20;
* Apple’s App Store



## Distributed Systems

> **Distributed System**:
>
> data and computation are replicated across multiple nodes in a network in what users view as a single, coherent system



## Parallel Computing System

> **Parallel Computing System**:&#x20;
>
> computation is performed by all nodes simultaneously to achieve a single result
>
> * **System is centralized in nature**: there is still a central authority that has control over all nodes and governs processing
> * E.g: used in weather research and forecasting, simulation, and financial modeling



## Decentralized Systems

> **Decentralized System**:
>
> a type of network where nodes are not dependent on a single master node; instead, **control is distributed** between many nodes.

#### Analogous to a model&#x20;

* where each department in an organization is in charge of its own database server&#x20;
* thus, taking away the power from the central server and distributing it to the sub-departments, who manage their own databases



### Decentralized Consensus

> **Decentralized Consensus**:
>
> enables a user to **agree** on something **via a consensus algorithm** without the need for a central, trusted third party, intermediary, or service provider

* a significant innovation in the decentralized paradigm&#x20;
* came into play with Bitcoin

{% hint style="info" %}
* Traditional Centralized System:&#x20;
  * has a central controller&#x20;
  * represents the usual client/server model
* Distributed System:
  * still have a central controller
  * but the system comprises many dispersed nodes
* Decentralized System:
  * no controller controlling the networks

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Decentralized** and **Distributed** Network



**Similar**: from a topological point of view

**Key Difference**: Decentralized system **doesn’t have a central authority** that controls the network
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
A **traditional distributed system**:

comprises **many servers performing different roles**.
{% endhint %}



<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/blockchain-based-decentralized-system.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Blockchain-based Decentralized System [1]</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
**A blockchain-based decentralized system**:

decentralized system (based on blockchain) where an **exact replica** of the applications and data is maintained across the entire network on each participating node

\*\* notice the direct P2P connections and the exact replicas of blocks (data)

### **Fault Tolerance: Centralized Vs Decentralized**&#x20;

> **Fault Tolerance**:&#x20;
>
> the ability of a system to continue operating even if some of its components fail



{% hint style="success" %}
Centralized system is considerably less fault-tolerant than a decentralized distributed blockchain system
