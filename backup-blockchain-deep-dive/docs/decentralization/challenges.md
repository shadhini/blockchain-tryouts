# Challenges

Challenges that needs to be examined thoroughly in a decentralized system

* Security requirements
* Software bugs&#x20;
* Human error



E.g: In decentralized systems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, security is provided by private keys.&#x20;

Hence, we need to handle

* the loss of an asset or token linked to private keys due to code bugs or negligence
* scenarios like losing private keys due to user negligence
* the decentralized application becoming vulnerable to attack due to a bug in the smart contract code
