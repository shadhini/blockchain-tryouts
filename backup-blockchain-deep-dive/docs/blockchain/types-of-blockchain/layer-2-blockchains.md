Layer 2 Blockchain Solutions

* Sidechains
* Zero-Knowledge Rollups
* Optimistic Rollups
* Plasma Chains&#x20;
* Lightning Network



## Sidechains&#x20;

> **Sidechain**:
>
> precisely known as “**`pegged sidechains`**”
>
> A concept whereby **coins can be moved** from one blockchain to another and then back again

### One-way Pegged Sidechain:&#x20;

Example Use case

*   Creation of new `altcoins` (**alternative cryptocurrencies**) whereby coins are burnt as a proof of an adequate stake.&#x20;

    * “**`Burnt`**” or “**`burning the coins`**” means that the coins are sent to an address that is un spendable, and this process makes the “_burnt_” coins irrecoverable.&#x20;
    * This mechanism is used to **bootstrap a new currency** or **introduce** **scarcity**, which results in the increased value of the coin.&#x20;

    ╰**---**➤ “**`Proof of Burn`**” : used as an _alternative method for distributed consensus_ to `PoW` and Proof of Stake (`PoS`)



### Two-way Pegged Sidechain:&#x20;

> **Two-way Pegged Sidechain**:
>
> allows the movement of coins from the main chain to the sidechain and back to the main chain when required



Example Use cases

* `Rootstock` enables smart contract development for `Bitcoin` using this paradigm.&#x20;
  * works by allowing a two-way peg for the Bitcoin blockchain, and this results in much faster throughput.&#x20;
* `Deku`, a side chain layer 2 solution for `Tezos`.&#x20;
