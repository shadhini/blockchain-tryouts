### Distributed Ledger Vs Blockchain&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**All blockchains** are fundamentally **distributed ledgers/shared databases**.

But not all distributed ledgers are necessarily blockchains.
{% endhint %}

* a distributed ledger does not necessarily consist of blocks of transactions to keep the ledger growing.
  * &#x20;R3â€™s [Corda](https://www.corda.net): a distributed ledger that does not use blocks of transaction
    * developed to record and manage agreements &#x20;
    * especially focused on the financial services industry
* a blockchain is a special type of shared database that comprises blocks of transactions.&#x20;
  * Bitcoin, Ethereum: make use of blocks composed of transactions to update the replicated shared database



## Shared Ledger&#x20;

> **Shared Ledger**:
>
> generic term that describe **any application or database** that is **shared by the public or a consortium**

{% hint style="info" %}
**All blockchains** fall into the category of a **shared ledger**.
{% endhint %}
