# Layer 1 Blockchains

> **Layer 1 Blockchain**:
>
> Any base layer chain, responsible for consensus&#x20;
>
> * a **single base layer** is the **source of canonical truth**

E.g:&#x20;

* Bitcoin &#x20;
* Ethereum



## Monolithic Blockchains

> **Monolithic Blockchain**:
>
> just one base layer responsible for all operations
>
>
>
> â€” **no component is off chain**
>
> *   All functionalities including&#x20;
>
>     * programmability (smart contracts),&#x20;
>     * consensus protocol,&#x20;
>     * security, and&#x20;
>     * any related functionality&#x20;
>
>     are part of the same base blockchain

E.g: monolithic chains; base layer single-chain protocols

* Bitcoin
* Ethereum &#x20;
* Solana



## Polylithic Blockchains&#x20;

> **Polylithic Blockchain**:
>
> composed of multiple chains; can think of these as multi-chain architectures
>
> * multiple chains of the same or different types connect to a core chain and form a network of networks
> * chains are **horizontal to** the **core chain**&#x20;
>   * in some cases the core chain is not strictly needed and subnets can talk to each other directly
>
>
>
> **Homogeneous Chains**:
>
> If chains connecting to the core chain are all the same type and built using the same rules
>
>
>
> **Heterogeneous Chains**:
>
> If chains are of different types and follow different rules&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**Multichain** architectures **aim** to be **heterogeneous** architectures
{% endhint %}

&#x20;

E.g: polylithic chains&#x20;

* Polkadot
* Avalanche&#x20;
* Cosmos
