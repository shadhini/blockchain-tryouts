# Limitations of Blockchain Technology

## Limitations

1. Scalability
2. Regulation
3. Privacy
4. Relatively immature technology
5. Interoperability
6. Adoption

### 1. Scalability

— scalability need to be improved



### 2. Regulation

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to its **decentralized** **nature**, **regulation** is **almost impossible** on blockchain.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Sometimes seen as a barrier toward adoption&#x20;
  * Traditionally, due to the existence of regulatory authorities, consumers have a certain level of confidence that if something goes wrong they can hold someone accountable.&#x20;
  * In blockchain networks, **no such regulatory authority and control** exists.



{% hint style="info" %}
There are attempts to regulate blockchain networks.

* The legalisation of cryptocurrency exchanges in the US under the Bank secrecy act.
  * to make sure cryptocurrency exchanges adhere to requirements such as&#x20;
    * Anti-Money Laundering (`AML`)
    * Counter Financing of Terrorism (`CFT`)&#x20;
    * enforce strict record keeping and reporting to the authorities
* **Central Bank Digital Currency** (`CBDC`)
  * a centralized and regulated form of digital currency issued by a central bank of a country
{% endhint %}



### 3. Privacy

Concern on public blockchains where everyone can see every single transaction.&#x20;

* e.g: Bitcoin&#x20;

Transparency is not desirable in industries, such as &#x20;

* financial
* law&#x20;
* medical sectors

{% hint style="info" %}
Solutions like **Zcash** leverage **zero-knowledge proofs** to enable **anonymous transactions**, addressing this limitation.
{% endhint %}

### 4. Relatively immature technology

— comparatively new technology and requires research to achieve maturity



Some features need to be improved further

* user experience
* developer experience
* security&#x20;
* interoperability

Applications that needs further maturity in terms of regulation, governance, and security.&#x20;

* DeFi &#x20;
* Metaverses&#x20;

### 5. Interoperability

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Blockchains cannot exist in silos**; they must be able to communicate with one another, as well as enterprise networks and legacy systems

— to fully benefit from the technology
{% endhint %}

> **Twofold** problem:
>
> 1. Interoperability of blockchains with **enterprise and legacy systems**
> 2. Interoperability between different blockchains (**cross-chain interoperability**)



{% hint style="info" %}
Solutions suggested in recent years

* **bridges**
* **hub blockchains**&#x20;
* **multi-chain heterogeneous chains**
{% endhint %}



### 6. Adoption

Often, blockchain is seen as a nascent technology.&#x20;

Aspects need to be addressed before further adoption

* scalability
* security
* regulation&#x20;
* customer confidence
  * can decrease due to security issues leading to loss of funds

{% hint style="info" %}
Despite problems, **DeFi** is becoming more and more **popular**.

But it might discourage **cautious** **customers**.
{% endhint %}





## Transparency Vs Confidentiality

> **`Trade off between Transparency and Confidentiality`**
>
> * Blockchain typically prioritises **transparency** over **confidentiality**,&#x20;
>   * this hinder adoption by industries requiring **private and confidential transactions**, such as financial institutions.&#x20;
> * While confidentiality is not always essential—e.g., in Bitcoin's case—there are scenarios where it is desirable.&#x20;
