# Discussion Points

## Transparency Vs Confidentiality

> **`Trade off between Transparency and Confidentiality`**
>
> * Blockchain typically prioritises **transparency** over **confidentiality**,&#x20;
>   * this hinder adoption by industries requiring **private and confidential transactions**, such as financial institutions.&#x20;
> * While confidentiality is not always essential—e.g., in Bitcoin's case—there are scenarios where it is desirable.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Solutions like **Zcash** leverage **zero-knowledge proofs** to enable **anonymous transactions**, addressing this limitation.
{% endhint %}



## Smart Contract Executability

{% hint style="info" %}
**Not all blockchains have** a mechanism to execute **smart contracts;**

But it is **desirable** due to flexibility and power it provides to blockchain applications.



Smart contract functionality is **not incorporated** in some blockchains **on purpose**&#x20;

* citing the reason that hardcoded executions are faster without the complexities of general-purpose smart contracts.
