# The Growth of Blockchain Technology

## The History of Blockchain

1976:   `Diffie–Hellman` work on securely exchanging cryptographic keys.&#x20;

1978:   Invention of `public key cryptography`.&#x20;

1979:   Invention of `Merkle trees` (hashes in a tree structure) by Ralph C. Merkle.&#x20;

1980s: Development of `TCP/IP`.&#x20;

1980:  `Protocols` for `public key` cryptosystems, Ralph C. Merkle.&#x20;

1982:  `Blind signatures` proposed by David Chaum.&#x20;

1982:  The `Byzantine Generals problem`.&#x20;

1985:  Work on `elliptic curve cryptography` by Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller.&#x20;

1991:  Haber and Stornetta work on `tamper-proofing document timestamps`.&#x20;

&#x20;          — This can be considered the earliest idea of a chain of blocks or hash chains.&#x20;

1992:  Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor publish _Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail_.&#x20;

&#x20;          — This is considered the first use of `PoW`.&#x20;

1993:  Haber, Bayer, and Stornetta upgraded the `tamper-proofing of document timestamps system with Merkle trees`.

1995:  David Chaum’s _`Digicash`_ system (an `anonymous electronic cash system`) started to be used in some banks.&#x20;

1998:  _`Bit Gold`_, a mechanism for `decentralized digital currency`, invented by Nick Szabo.

&#x20;           — It used `hash chaining` and `Byzantine Quorums`.&#x20;

1999:  Emergence of a `file-sharing application` mainly used for music sharing, _`Napster`_, which is a P2P network, but was `centralized` with the use of indexing servers.&#x20;

1999:  Development of a `secure timestamping service` for the Belgian project _`TIMESEC`_.&#x20;

2000: _`Gnutella`_ `file-sharing network`, which introduced `decentralization`.&#x20;

2001:  Emergence of _`BitTorrent`_ and `Distributed Hash Tables` (**DHT**s).&#x20;

2002: _`Hashcash`_ by Adam Back.&#x20;

2004: Development of _`B-Money`_ by Wei Dei using Hashcash.&#x20;

2004: Hal Finney, the invention of the `reusable PoW` system.&#x20;

2005: `Prevention of Sybil attacks` by using computation puzzles, due to James Aspnes et al.&#x20;

2009: _`Bitcoin`_ (`first blockchain`).

## The Growth of Blockchain Technology

{% hint style="success" %}
Blockchain

* has an impact on **current technologies**
* possesses the ability to change them at a **fundamental level**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Progress in blockchain** technology resembles the **internet dot-com boom** of the late 1990s.
{% endhint %}

2008:&#x20;

* Invention of `Bitcoin`
* Introduction of **concept** Blockchain; the underlying technology of Bitcoin

2009:

* Practical implementation of Bitcoin `[first blockchain]`
  * First practical implementation of an **e-cash system**

{% hint style="info" %}
Blockchain technology was initially dismissed as mere "**geek money**", viewed solely through the lens of cryptocurrency.
{% endhint %}

2013:

* Ideas emerged regarding using blockchain for **other applications** apart from cryptocurrencies

2014:

* **Research and experiments** began that led to **`PoC's`** (proofs of concept) and further research

2015-2017

* **Full-scale trial projects**
* 2015: `Ethereum` was launched; the first smart contract programmable blockchain
* Origin of interest in **enterprise-grade blockchains**&#x20;
* Several projects: `Everledger`, `Quorum`, `Corda`

After 2018:

* Development of **novel monolithic and multichain architectures** rapidly evolved
* Novel protocols: `Solana`, `Avalanche`, `Polkadot`

2022 and onwards:

* trend is expected to grow&#x20;
* more research and development
* more focus on the **regulation, standardisation** and **security**
* numerous projects are already production ready
* more adoption is expected
* development of **layer 2 architectures/solutions** and **multi-chain architectures**
  * led by research on scalability of blockchains; where blockchain can handle many transactions like traditional financial networks&#x20;
  * realised with the help of advancement in making zero-knowledge proofs practical&#x20;
  * under heavy research and development now&#x20;
  * mechanisms introduced: `Plasma`, `rollups`, `sidechains`, `Lightning Network` and etc

Second quarter of 2023:

* Popular Blockchain Applications:
  * Decentralized Finance (`DeFi`)
  * Non-Fungible Tokens (`NFT`s)
  * Tokenization
* Mainstream Usage:
  * Engagement in `DeFi` services
  * `NFT` trading
  * `Cryptocurrency` transactions
  * `Metaverse` experiences
  * Blockchain-based payments, loans, and gaming
* Need for Maturity:
  * Stronger `regulations` and `security` measures
*   Driving Force:

    * Financial incentives from trading and investing in digital assets (NFTs, DeFi)
