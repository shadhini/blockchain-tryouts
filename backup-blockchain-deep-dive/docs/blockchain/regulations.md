# Regulations

#### Requirement of  Changing Data in Blockchain

There may also be some legitimate reasons to change data in the blockchain once it has been added, such as the “**right to be forgotten**” or “**right to erasure**” (also defined in the **`GDPR`** ruling: https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/).&#x20;

`right to be forgotten`: the right that mandates personal data about a person to be removed from internet records, organizational records, and other associated services.&#x20;
