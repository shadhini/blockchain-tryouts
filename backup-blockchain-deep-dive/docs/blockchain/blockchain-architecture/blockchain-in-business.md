# Blockchain in Business

{% hint style="info" %}
The current traditional business model is **centralized**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

E.g.:&#x20;

* cash transfers -> banks act as a central trusted third party&#x20;
* financial trading -> a central clearing house acts as a trusted third party between two or more trading parties



> From a business standpoint,&#x20;
>
> a **blockchain** is a platform where peers can exchange value using transactions **without** the need for a centrally trusted arbitrator (**a trusted third party**)
>
>
>
> This disintermediation allows blockchain to be a **decentralized** mechanism where **no single authority controls the network**.&#x20;



### Benefits of Decentralisation provided by Blockchain

If no banks or central clearing houses are required, then it  leads to&#x20;

* cost savings,&#x20;
* faster transaction speeds,&#x20;
* transparency, and&#x20;
* more trust.&#x20;



In the payment business, blockchain can be used to facilitate **cross-border and local payments** in a **decentralized and secure** manner.&#x20;
