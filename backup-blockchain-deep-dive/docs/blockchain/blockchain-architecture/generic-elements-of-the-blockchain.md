<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/blockchain-network.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Generic structure of a 4-node Blockchain Network</p></figcaption></figure>

In this 4-node blockchain network

* each node maintains&#x20;
  * a chain of blocks,&#x20;
  * virtual machine,&#x20;
  * state machine, and&#x20;
  * address.&#x20;

## Other Elements

* Peer-to-peer network
* Scripting/programming language
* Virtual machine
* State machine
* Smart Contracts
* Node

### Peer-to-peer network

> **Peer-to-peer network**:
>
> A **network topology** wherein&#x20;
>
> * **all peers** can **communicate with each other** directly and&#x20;
> * &#x20;send and receive **messages**.&#x20;



### The scripting or programming language

Scripts/programs perform various operations on a transaction to facilitate various functions.&#x20;

E.g:&#x20;

* In `Bitcoin`,&#x20;
  * transaction scripts are predefined in a language called `Script`;
  * `Script`
    * a simple scripting language to define transaction rules, allowing for basic operations like transferring coins between addresses.
    * designed for specific transaction purposes and doesn't support complex programming.
    * **not `Turing complete`**
* `Ethereum`’s `Solidity`&#x20;
  * Turing complete

{% hint style="info" %}
**Turing Complete** language -> can perform any computation, has loops and branching capabilities to perform complex computations

* named after Alan Turing, who developed the idea of a _Turing machine_, which can run any algorithm, however complex.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To enable more complex applications on blockchains, a **Turing-complete** programming language is required, allowing for more flexible and versatile development.
{% endhint %}



### Virtual machine

> **Virtual Machine**:&#x20;
>
> allows **Turing-complete code to be run on a blockchain** (as **`smart contracts`**), whereas a transaction script is limited in its operation.&#x20;

Example uses of virtual machines to run programs&#x20;

* `EVM` -> used in `Ethereum` blockchain
* Chain Virtual Machine (`CVM`) -> used in an enterprise-grade blockchain “`Chain Core`”

{% hint style="info" %}
Virtual machines are not available on all blockchains.
{% endhint %}



### State machine

> A **blockchain** can be viewed as&#x20;
>
> &#x20; a **state transition mechanism** whereby a state is modified from its initial form to the next one&#x20;
>
> &#x20; **by nodes** on the blockchain network&#x20;
>
> &#x20; as a result of transaction execution.

&#x20;

### Smart contracts

> **Smart Contracts**:
>
> * Automated, autonomous **programs** that reside/run on the blockchain network &#x20;
> * **encapsulate the business logic and code** needed to execute a required function when certain conditions are met
> * contains
>   * business logic
>   * limited amount of data&#x20;
> * either actors/participants in the blockchain utilize smart contracts or they are run autonomously on behalf of network participants
>
> — enforceable and automatically executable



{% hint style="info" %}
**Smart contracts do not necessarily need a blockchain to run**;&#x20;

But, blockchain technology has become the standard decentralized execution platform for smart contracts due to its security benefits.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Not all blockchains have** a mechanism to execute **smart contracts;**

But it is **desirable** due to flexibility and power it provides to blockchain applications.



Smart contract functionality is **not incorporated** in some blockchains **on purpose**&#x20;

* citing the reason that hardcoded executions are faster without the complexities of general-purpose smart contracts.
{% endhint %}

Example use cases of Smart Contracts

* identity management
* capital markets
* trade finance
* record management
* insurance
* e-governance



### Node

> **Node** in a blockchain network :
>
> performs **various functions depending on the role** that it takes on.
>
> * **miners** that create new blocks and mint cryptocurrency (coins)&#x20;
>   * propose and validate transactions, perform mining to facilitate consensus and secure the blockchain
>   * achieved by following a consensus protocol (most commonly PoW)
> * **block signers** that validate and digitally sign the transactions
> * simple payment verification (lightweight nodes)

1. **Transactions** are first **created** by nodes &#x20;
2. Then **transactions** are **digitally signed** by nodes using private keys&#x20;
   * as proof that they are the _legitimate owner of the asset_ that they wish to transfer to someone else on the blockchain network&#x20;
3. This **asset** is usually a **token** or **virtual currency** or any real-world asset represented on the blockchain by using tokens.&#x20;
   * There are standards related to tokens that define the interfaces and semantics of tokenisation
     * E.g:  on Ethereum, ERC20, ERC721, ERC777, and a few others
