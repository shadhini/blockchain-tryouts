# Communication

{% hint style="success" %}
**Requirement:** &#x20;

Individual users has full control and access to their data and&#x20;

it's not dependent on a single third party
{% endhint %}





## The Internet

* the communication layer in blockchain
* appears to be decentralized
  * original vision was to build a decentralized network
  * but with the rise of large-scale service providers like `Google`, `Amazon`, and `eBay`, control has shifted towards these giants — **Internet's shift towards centralization**
    * E.g: Email
      * Email is a decentralized system; anyone can run an email server with minimal effort
      * but centralized services like `Gmail` and `Outlook` offer convenience, security, and free use -> thus, there is a natural inclination toward selecting one of these centralized services
      * Many users are unaware that these services are free but expose their valuable personal data.
* Internet access relies on ISPs as a central hub, and communication is halted if the ISP is shut down.



## Mesh Networks

* utilize wireless technologies like `Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)` for decentralized communication,&#x20;
  * allowing nodes in proximity to communicate directly **without** the need for an **Internet** **or central hub**.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Network that allows users to be in control of their communication:**

— no one can shut it down for any reason

* allows to be unaffected during natural disasters, war zones, or protests against oppressive regimes that might block Internet
* E.g: offline messaging app —  `bridgefy`
